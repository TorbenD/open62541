Building the Library
====================

Building the Single-File Release
--------------------------------

Using the GCC compiler, the following calls build the library on Linux.

.. code-block:: bash

   gcc -std=c99 -fPIC -c open62541.c
   gcc -shared open62541.o -o libopen62541.so

Building with CMake on Ubuntu or Debian
---------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

   sudo apt-get install git build-essential gcc pkg-config cmake python

   # enable additional features
   sudo apt-get install liburcu-dev # for multithreading
   sudo apt-get install check # for unit tests
   sudo apt-get install sphinx # for documentation generation

   cd open62541
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make

   # select additional features
   ccmake ..
   make

Building with CMake on Windows
------------------------------

Here we explain the build process for Visual Studio (2013 or newer). To build
with MinGW, just replace the compiler selection in the call to CMake.

- Download and install

  - Python 2.7.x (Python 3.x should work, too): https://python.org/downloads
  - CMake: http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
  - Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition: https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs

- Download the open62541 sources (using git or as a zipfile from github)
- Open a command shell (cmd) and run

.. code-block:: bat

   cd <path-to>\open62541
   mkdir build
   cd build
   <path-to>\cmake.exe .. -G "Visual Studio 14 2015"
   :: You can use use cmake-gui for a graphical user-interface to select single features

- Then open "build\open62541.sln" in Visual Studio 2015 and build as usual

Building on OS X
----------------

- Download and install

  - Xcode: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12
  - Homebrew: http://brew.sh/
  - Pip (a package manager for python, may be preinstalled): ``sudo easy_install pip``

- Run the following in a shell

.. code-block:: bash

   brew install cmake
   brew install libxml2
   brew install check # for unit tests
   brew install userspace-rcu # for multi-threading support
   brew install graphviz doxygen # for documentation generation
   pip install sphinx # for documentation generation

Follow Ubuntu instructions without the ``apt-get`` commands as these are taken care of by the above packages.

Build Options
-------------

**CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE**
  - RelWithDebInfo: -O2 optimization with debug symbols
  - Release: -O2 optimization without debug symbols
  - Debug: -O0 optimization with debug symbols
  - MinSizeRel: -Os optimization without debug symbols

**UA_LOGLEVEL**
   The level of logging events that are reported
   - 600: Fatal and all below
   - 500: Error and all below
   - 400: Error and all below
   - 300: Info and all below
   - 200: Debug and all below
   - 100: Trace and all below

Further options that are not inherited from the CMake configuration are defined
in ua_config.h. Usually there is no need to adjust them.

UA_BUILD_* group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default only the shared object libopen62541.so or the library open62541.dll
and open62541.dll.a resp. open62541.lib are build. Additional artifacts can be
specified by the following options:

**UA_BUILD_DOCUMENTATION**
   Generate documentation with doxygen
**UA_BUILD_EXAMPLECLIENT**
   Compile example clients from client.c. There are a static and a dynamic binary client and client_static, respectively
**UA_BUILD_EXAMPLESERVER**
   Compile example server from server.c There are a static and a dynamic binary server and server_static, respectively
**UA_BUILD_UNIT_TESTS**
   Compile unit tests with Check framework. The tests can be executed with make test
**UA_BUILD_EXAMPLES**
   Compile specific examples from https://github.com/acplt/open62541/blob/master/examples/
**UA_BUILD_SELFIGNED_CERTIFICATE**
   Generate a self-signed certificate for the server (openSSL required)

UA_ENABLE_* group
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This group contains build options related to the supported OPC UA features.

**UA_ENABLE_SUBSCRIPTIONS**
   Enable subscriptions
**UA_ENABLE_METHODCALLS**
   Enable method calls in server and client
**UA_ENABLE_NODEMANAGEMENT**
   Node management services (adding and removing nodes and references) at runtime in server and client
**UA_ENABLE_AMALGAMATION**
   Compile a single-file release files open62541.c and open62541.h
**UA_ENABLE_MULTITHREADING**
   Enable multi-threading support (experimental)
**UA_ENABLE_COVERAGE**
   Measure the coverage of unit tests
**UA_ENABLE_EMBEDDED_LIBC**
   Use a custom implementation of some libc functions that might be missing on embedded targets (e.g. string handling).

Some options are marked as advanced. The advanced options need to be toggled to
be visible in the cmake GUIs.

**UA_ENABLE_EXTERNAL_NAMESPACES**
   Enable external namespaces in server
**UA_ENABLE_GENERATE_NAMESPACE0**
   Enable automatic generation of NS0
**UA_ENABLE_GENERATE_NAMESPACE0_FILE**
   File for NS0 generation from namespace0 folder. Default value is Opc.Ua.NodeSet2.xml
**UA_ENABLE_NONSTANDARD_STATELESS**
   Stateless service calls
**UA_ENABLE_NONSTANDARD_UDP**
   UDP network layer
